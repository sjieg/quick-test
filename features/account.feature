#@account
#Feature: User accounts
#  This feature will make sure the user account functionality is working as expected
#  By checking registration, login and logout functionality
#
#  # This is a best practise example. Please note the following
#  # By defining a register, log-in and log-out state, we can easily re-use all these preconditions
#  # All the scenario's aren't completed, but it should be easy to implement it into your own project.
#
#  @account01 @log_in #@pause # You can add @pause to have a break between every step.
#  Scenario: account01 - Logging in
#    Given the user is logged out
#    When "default-user" logs in
#    Then the page should display as logged in state
#
#  @account02 @log_out
#  Scenario: account01 - Logging out
#    Given "default-user" is logged in
#    When the user clicks on the logout button
#    Then the page should display as logged out state
#
#  @account03 @registration
#  Scenario: account03 - Registation
#    Given the user is logged out
#    When "random-user" registers for a new account
#    Then the page should display as logged in state
