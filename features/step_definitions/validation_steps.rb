# validation_steps.rb is used to confirm that certain elements are displayed on the page.

Then(/text "([^"]*)" should display/) do |string|
  # Note: The following is *really* slow, as it'll apply the regex to all
  #       elements in the page, one after the other. Of course, if any element
  #       includes the regex, all its parent elements also will, so you have
  #       tons of matches to process.
  #
  # browser.wait(:text => /#{string}/i)

  #       Instead, you will want to search only the root element for some
  #       text, e.g.
  #
  # browser.wait(:html => {:text => /#{string}/i})

  #       There's a shortcut for that in find/wait:
  browser.wait(:html => /#{string}/i)
end

  # Get the expected url
  expected_url = env('pages.root')
  expected_url += env("pages.#{page}")

  # A custom loop that waits 5 seconds until the expected_url is the same as the current url
  start = Time.now
  while browser.url != expected_url
    break if (Time.now - start).to_i >= 5
    sleep(0.1)
  end

  # Check if they are the same
  if browser.url != expected_url

  end
end

  # Adjust variable for checking logged in or logged out state.

  end


  # Try to find a way to confirm that a user is logged out.
  # Easiest way is to a reversed check on an element that is only present when you're logged in
  # For example, the profile picture
  browser.wait(
    :img => {:class => 'user-gravatar'},
